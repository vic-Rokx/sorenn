## Artist Statement

My artworks (public bronze sculptures, paintings and installations) are all about the stories and narratives behind the visual imagery presented. It is about what is below the surfaces, the holes and breaking the surface to convey deeper meaning or stories whether they are perceived as warm, positive, uncomfortable, raw or confusing – with humour. I love that often people convey their own stories and interpretation of my works, and talking to people without judgement is very much part of my practice.

Visually I am inspired by the 17th century techniques and old masters into a contemporary presentation of the human figure – or human story, intermixing pop-art, graffiti, comics, cartoons with the figurative and realism and abstract expressionism, in a refreshed visual approach sort of experimenting with Willem de Kooning, Caravaggio, Tintoretto and Low-brow comics in a contemporary context, so the audience can see the raw or warm positive realities of our world today without biases.

My public bronze sculptures are infused with multifaceted narratives centred on living in today's world using contemporary imagery and humour to make it approachable and current.
